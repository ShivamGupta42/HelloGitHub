# HelloGitHub
This is my first repository that I am creating to hack through the bushes of the amazon of GitHub. 
I am learning the befits of git over svn 

Till now i have learnt: 

1) It will be easier for many developers to merge their code together after seeing what other are working upon. 
2) It will be easier to track issue related with code.
